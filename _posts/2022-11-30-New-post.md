## This is my first blog ever! 

Today I will talk about what I learned in my first Software/QA Testing class. 

First things first. I am currently interested in a role as a QA Tester. The QA Tester takes part in all SDLC Phases. The tester always focuses on the user and the quality of a product.

What does QA stand for? what does it mean? 

Well, a QA stands for quality assurance. Quality Assurance is a process used to determine if a product meets certain specifications for an end user.

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) usually contains the following phases: Plan, Design, Develop, Test, Deploy.

A test strategy should develop during the planning phase.

You should solidify test scenarios and get feedabck from the team during the build and design phase.
